# Website vs WebApp vs MobileApp :page_facing_up::earth_africa::iphone:

## Website :page_facing_up:

A website is a *compilation of a set of web pages* viewed with a browser. It is a static set of pages that offer viewers with details. It does not allow viewers to carry out interaction with it.

Think of a conference where attendees do not involve in interaction.

## WebApp :earth_africa:

WebApp are *interactive websites* like Facebook, Youtube etc. User engagement is an integral part of web applications.

Think of a networking event where it is necessary for audiences to engage for value enhancement.

## MobileApp :iphone:

MobileApp were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email, calendar, and contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile games, factory automation, GPS and location-based services, order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are now millions of apps available.

### NativeApp

- App that is targeted towards specific mobile platform
- An App meant for Apple devices will never run on Android
- Best performance

### HybridApp

- Mix of NativeApp and WebApp
- Single code that works in multiple operating system
- Slower in speed compared to NativeApp, faster compared to WebApp

### WebBasedApp

- Strong internet connection is required for proper function and user-experience of this group of app
- Less memory footprint of device as data is fetched from servers
- Developers do not get sufficient access to specific mobile operating system API
